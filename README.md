# Something-like-a-Database

## Very First Project

Simple Database like program that reads a list of the top movies for 2020,  from IMDB's website.
The data(views, rating, genre, links to trailer etc.) is stored in a data structure and used to perform various Satistical Operations and Comparisons.

## What I Learnt:
>> Array data Structure
>> Reading / Writing to files
>> C++ functions and Syntax
>> Open a URL from devC++
